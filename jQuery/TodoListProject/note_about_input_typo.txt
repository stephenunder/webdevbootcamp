Note about next lecture (Creating Todos):
Section 18, Lecture 198
Hi All!
There's a typo in the following video at the 50 second mark. 
Where it says: $("input[type='text'").keypress(function(event){ 
it should actually be: $("input[type='text']").keypress(function(event){ the lecture version is missing a closing square bracket around the type attribute.
The solution code has been updated to reflect this correction.

Sorry for any confusion. :)

Thanks,
Ian
