#Intro to NPM

* Define NPM
* Explain why NPM is awesome
* Intro the packages we will end up using

#Installing and Using Packages

* Use `npm install` to install a package
* Use `require()` to include a package

* Also (for the next lecture), the cat-me package has changed slightly since the video was created. Now, when you open up the cat-me folder from within the node_modules directory you will find all of the cats inside of cats.json (instead of cats.js).
